# Sentiment-Analysis
This repository is my introduction to sentiment analysis, guided by Nicholas Renotte. Here, I explore using BERT neural network and Python. I scrape reviews from Yelp and use a specific pre-trained BERT model from Hangman to score each review's sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

Features
Review Scraping: I gather real-world data from Yelp reviews.
Sentiment Scoring: The model classifies the sentiment of each review, providing insight into overall tone.
Python & BERT Integration: Combining Python for data handling with BERT for sentiment analysis.
This project is my hands-on start in natural language processing and machine learning.
